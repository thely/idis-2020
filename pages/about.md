## Project 1: 1996 Geocities nostalgia

Before Squarespace and Wix, there were an array of free webhosts, none of which gave you any guidance as to good web design. Geocities, Lycos, and Angelfire were the most frequent, but there were (I'm sure) others that have since died. Their models were not especially economically sound, but we'll make some really abysmal web pages in their honor.

### Stage 1
Invent a character who is ready to create their first webpage on something as rudimentary as Geocities. Who are they? What’s their name? What do they like? How old are they? Why are they making this site? (Common themes: fan pages, sharing art, serial stories, small business sites)

Make their landing page. This should include a mix of text (with different fonts, font colors/stylings), images (static and animated), likely some autoplaying background audio, anchor links to parts of the page, and a few embeds from other sites. Go to as many extremes as you want––these pages did not often look very good. Things to think about: do they share their face? Do they have an alias? Are they good at what they do? Do they use emoticons?

### Stage 2
Talk to 2-3 people in class, and figure out how your characters know each other. How would they link to one another's sites? You may need to add a page to your site to make this work.

### Requirements
**Technical requirements:**

* necessary header tags: html, head, body, title
* body tags (at least one each): p, img, one of the h1-h6 headers, a
* ultra-basic CSS: change the font, its color
* include at least one thing from [Dynamic Drive](http://www.dynamicdrive.com/)

**Artistic requirements:**

I don't need to be fully convinced that this character is a real person (maybe it's more interesting if they aren't?), but there should be evidence that you put effort in. The visual style of this era was pretty ugly, so it's more period-appropriate if it looks as ugly as you can manage.

## Project 2: In the real world
All forms of media are telling stories, even if they don't appear to initially. Make a false article or fake product page, and tell a story through it. Is the product solving a problem, or satisfying a need? Is the article addressing a specific viewpoint? What's the subtext of what's being said? Is the author from the present day, or from the past/future? Are they from our reality at all?

### Stage 1
Brainstorm some ideas in class, in a group. What are some possible problems, solutions, current issues, invented issues, etc., that might be interesting to write about? Pick one. Multiple people can pick the same product/article idea without needing to be a group.

### Stage 2
Make a mockup of your ideas. The text doesn't need to be final––you can include as much lorem ipsum as you need. Use greyed-out blocks for images if you're not sure what you're using yet. We'll look at each other's mockups in class to critique both content and appearance.

### Stage 3
Final content.

### Requirements

**Technical requirements:**

* HTML: some use of div, span, article, section
* CSS: some use of width/height, box model properties (border/padding/margins), and floats

**Artistic requirements:**

This doesn't need to look "perfect," but should use space intentionally. Images won't have margins set by default, and they won't respond well when floated without them set. The nature of your article/product should also be clear, or clearly ambiguous––it should send a message, regardless of content.

## Project 3: Interactive "fiction"

Interactivity is the great enabler––it allows a system to respond to you, in ways that aren't possible just with separate pages. It powers every app you use, every game you play, every system that gets you incidentally addicted. While we don't have the time to fully explore game design, we can explore storytelling that responds to you, that involves some kind of change of state.

In this assignment, you'll develop a short story––mainly through text, but you're welcome to use mostly images instead, as long as it supports the experience you're interested in. We'll mainly be working with simple interactions, since this is an early coding project. Here are some easy JS interactions you may want to try:

* changing CSS properties on click/hover, like color, width/height, transform angle, font size
* elements appearing/disappearing on the page
* playing with mouse position
* changing element text

## Project 4: Multimedia smorgasbord

Build an experience or a story out of multimedia content. Do you want to overlap a bunch of unrelated tweets? Do you want to craft a foreboding soundscape? Maybe someone's travel diary? You have all kinds of tools at your disposal, but you aren't required to use all of them at once (unless you want to).

If you work in a group, it's appropriate for each person to mainly explore one part of the project (i.e., one person does sound in tone.js, the other does visuals in p5.js). You'll likely teach each other more about both libraries as you go.

### Requirements

Use at least two of the following:

* sound (e.g., howler.js, tone.js)
* video (no libraries to generate video - content is up to you. cannot be an embed)
* generative visuals (e.g., p5.js)
* maps (e.g., leaflet.js)
* embedded content (i.e. Twitter, YouTube), should be formatted somehow

## Final Project

The content of your final project is very flexible. What you wind up creating is entirely up to you, but it should utilize what you've learned this semester. Here are some suggestions:

* Something completely new, unrelated to any previous projects or assignments you've made for this class, but still in the vein of one of the previous projects. It could be net.art, interactive/digital fiction, net poetry, an article/product that tells a story, a fake social media profile or forum, etc.
* A continuation of one of the previous projects, as long as you can make significant additions to it. If you pick this option for project 4, you still need to turn in a working draft on the project 4 due date. If something you did for one of the in-class experiments inspired you, you can also use that as a jumping-off point.
* A portfolio site for the works you've already done in this class. You'll need to add some extra pages: an About page for yourself, a Works page for the projects, and one other page of your choice. Portfolio sites are a great tool for your future––I recommend you make one, even if you don't do it for this course. This can't be done as a group, unless you're doing a portfolio of your group as a collaborative artistic entity.
* A deeper exploration of a JS library we explored in class. The website component of this works best as a series of blog entries to show your progress, with one or two extensive examples using the library. Simple libraries like chart.js won't cut it.

### Stage 1

Discuss possible projects in class in a group, and then submit a project proposal online. Your final project may not look like what you proposed, but it's important to start with a plan. We'll talk about the feasibility of some of these options in class.

### Stage 2

Develop your project. We'll have some time during class to work on and discuss your projects––as with the rest of the semester, you're encouraged to riff off of one another.

### Stage 3

Turn in your project, and present it in class.

### Requirements

This project should test your skills. There is no hard requirement for how much HTML/CSS/JS you should use, but expect to use a good amount of everything.

Your presentation should be 8'-10' minutes long. It should include your inspiration, the development process, peaks and valleys you encountered on the way, and a demonstration of the project itself.
