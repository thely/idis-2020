## IDIS 2020
* Instructor: Becky Brown
* Email: rlb9fd \[at\] virginia \[dot\] edu
* Office: OCH 213


## Overview

The browser is an artifact we interact with constantly. We are delivered (and sometimes create) stories via these devices, in a myriad of ways, but not all of them are clear-cut. What narrative does a product’s site sell you? What world does an online article create for you? What art exists out there, emboldened, hindered, or inspired by the unique affordances of the internet?

In this class, we’ll explore both the practical side of web design/development, and the artistic side of expressing yourself in a multimedia landscape. We’ll go from the spartan days of 1996 to the present moment of working with text, image, video, animation, sound, and interactivity. And we’ll look at works from a variety of origins: the net.art movement, high-budget corporate websites, interactive fiction, the internet of things, and generative visuals. You’ll learn plenty, and you’ll be making projects constantly to achieve that––the learning you’ll do is heavily based on creating.

This course is enough to make you dangerous. Not dangerous like a hacker, or a troll, or Anonymous, or even a professional web developer, but as someone with enough knowledge to open more doors for yourself. The amount of information related to working with the internet is immense; this is only a beginning.

## Expectations

This class is intended for anyone interested in a confluence of art and code. Knowing how to program isn't a prerequisite––these skills will be taught during the course. Nor should you be scared of taking this course if you aren't sure you're "creative," because creativity is a skill that needs exercise like any other. It's expected, even preferrable, that everyone will fall in different places on the artistic vs technical spectrum.

## Required course “materials”

* Accounts on Github and Glitch
* Code-specific text editor like Sublime Text, Atom, Notepad++, or VS Code
* Access to a computer, optimally with internet

## Grading

This class is project-based, meaning the vast majority of the work (and proof of learning) is done through assignments. There are no tests in this class.

* Attendance: 20%
* Projects: 40%
* Final Project: 40%
 
The grading scale for the class is the default for Arts and Sciences, which can be found here.

## Assignments

Everything you turn in for this class will be a website, in some form or another. These will all be hand-coded, apart from various libraries we'll use. Under no circumstances are you to use Squarespace, Wix, or another drag-and-drop site builder to complete these assignments. (You won't have a good time, and I'll know you did it.) Unless you have your own hosting, you are welcome to put all your projects together using glitch.com.

**Assignments** will be simple, intended to explore a single idea, like positioning elements, or putting together a form. Everyone turns in assignments separately.

Larger **projects** are intended to flex you creatively, while still exploring the technology we're covering. You can work in groups for projects if you want, but this is not required. You can use an assignment as a starting point for a project, if the ideas you explored in the assignment were interesting to you.

Generally, the projects are not biased towards any specific style of art and/or storytelling. All that matters is that you approach them with some kind of intention, even if it's not complete.

Your **final project** will also include an in-class presentation.

## Participation

We'll be doing a lot of discussion in this class, so attendance and participation are important. Some of your projects have elements of collaboration to them, which are elements we cover in class.

## Plagiarism

Like an ouroboros, the internet can teach you how to make things within it, similar to reading books about writing, or watching movies about filmmaking. If you're experiencing bugs, Google them––it's likely you'll find a Stack Overflow question with exactly the right answer.

Using copyrighted content creatively is within the rules in this class. I encourage you to make your own content (images, videos, audio) to do these assignments if you know how or would like to learn, but college does not always allow this kind of time. If you do use someone else's media, as long as you cite the source somewhere (either in the page, or in your writeup), this is fine. Legally, the fact that we're not making money on these projects puts you in relatively safe ground.

*However*, plagiarizing the work of your fellow students, projects from past classes, or works available online is obviously forbidden. Not only is it against the honor code, but it's also shooting yourself in the foot. These are creative assignments––if your project is extremely similar to someone else's, I'll know.

## Schedule

In general, the semester will move from HTML (markup), to CSS (formatting), to JS (behavior). Most of the time, technical topics will be covered on Tuesdays, and discussion topics on Thursdays, but this will change during the semester depending on the intensity of one topic versus another.
